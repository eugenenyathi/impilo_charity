      "On her last day in Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls, she took a trip to Monde Village wherein she met Molita, one of the elders of that village and she toured her communal home and kitchens. Ondrea conversed with her on WhatsApp. From there, she asked if Shelomith would help to deliver food to the family once a month. Once Ondrea was aware of the hardships the villagers faced via the eyes and voice of Molita, the idea of creating a charity to help the entire village became Ondrea’s and Shelo’s inspiration and obsession.",
      "Hence. Impilo Uplifting Change Charity was formed. It was incorporated in California and a 401 3c US Internal Revenue tax exemption was granted. “Impilo” is Ndebele for “life” and as such, this charity will bring its true meaning by providing help to others. The goal is to help those in need thrive and become financially independent and become masters of their lives.",
      "Since that humble beginning many bold ideas have been exchanged between Ondrea and Shelomith and Molita, on how to create a vibrant, proud, and self-sustaining village. All the members of this charity hope in the future that our dreams for the village will be realized. We are committed to making it a success",

Having an investment trust fund are critical components that must be in place prior to well drilling and construction of the pump. There are many stories of well-meaning nonprofits boring a well to leave and then three years later, it becomes inoperative because of lack of regular maintenance and repairs.  When there is no money for repairs and maintenance, there is no rational reason to bore a well knowing it will eventually cease to operate. This charity seeks to break this cycle by creating ways for money-making ventures that will be sustainable.   This money will be kept in a trust fund maintained by  a co-op's board member who is elected as  treasurer (and likewise overseen by Impilo Uplifting Change Charity's staff).
