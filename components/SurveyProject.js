              Shelomith surveyed approximately 30 villagers, which is
              approximately 10% percent of the population, to access what is
              needed. A formal Needs Assessment will be created and passed to
              the majority of the villagers. Initially, the villagersâ€™ needs
              were to build a well, repairs to their homes and repair of their
              school. They wanted a well and additional rain harvest barrel
              collection locations. The long range goal is for the villagers to
              generate income in an entrepreneurial spirit so that the income
              derived from products made and skills learned will provide a
              better life for themselves and their families.
